Notes and Assumptions,,,,,,,,,,
Note 1,,,,"Aksara SSO is an enterprise Single Sign-On system with comprehensive employee lifecycle management, organizational structure versioning, and multi-company support. Peak usage occurs during organizational restructuring and employee onboarding periods.",,,OFM (Office Facility Management) is a real-time transportation and meeting booking system with GPS tracking. Write-heavy workload due to continuous GPS updates from vehicles (every 30 seconds during trips). Peak usage during morning/evening commute hours.,,
Note 2,,,,"Employee count is based on IAS organization structure (~1,200 employees across 150+ organizational units). System supports multi-tenant architecture for parent company + subsidiaries.",,,GPS tracking generates high write volume: 40 vehicles x 2 trips/day x 8 hours x 120 GPS points/hour = ~77K GPS points/day. This is the primary driver of storage needs.,,
Note 3,,,,"Org structure versioning creates large documents (50KB each with Mermaid diagrams) but low frequency. Historical compliance requirement means indefinite retention for employee records and SK Penempatan (assignment decrees).",,,Meeting rooms and transportation bookings have seasonal peaks (conference seasons, year-end events). Facility requests (ATK supplies) are steady throughout the year with slight monthly spikes.,,
Note 4,,,,"Recommended M10 tier for production provides 2GB RAM which exceeds working set requirements. Shared clusters (M0/M2) acceptable for dev/staging due to low concurrent usage.",,,Recommended M20 tier for production provides 4GB RAM and dedicated infrastructure to handle GPS write bursts and concurrent user requests. Scaling to M30 may be needed if fleet expands beyond 50 vehicles.,,
Note 5,,,,"Data retention for compliance: Employee history and audit logs must be kept for 5+ years. OAuth tokens and session data can be purged after 90 days.",,,GPS tracking data archived after 6 months but kept accessible for route analysis. OBD-II data valuable for predictive maintenance analytics (1-year retention). Consider time-series collections for GPS data optimization.,,
