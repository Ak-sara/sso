# Summary: Data Privacy & Compliance Analysis
# Aksara SSO System

**Date**: October 15, 2025
**Status**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL COMPLIANCE GAPS IDENTIFIED**

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Aksara SSO currently stores **sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII)** including NIK (KTP), NPWP, date of birth, and phone numbers in **unencrypted** MongoDB collections. This poses **significant legal and security risks** under Indonesian Data Protection Law (**UU No. 27 Tahun 2022**).

**Bottom Line**: System requires immediate security enhancements to comply with UU PDP regulations.

## 📊 Data Architecture: How Collections Relate

### Three Separate Collections

```
┌─────────────┐
│   USERS     │  ← LOGIN/AUTHENTICATION ONLY
│  (SSO Auth) │     - Email, password (hashed)
│             │     - Roles, permissions
└──────┬──────┘     - NO sensitive PII
       │
       │ userId (FK)
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  EMPLOYEES  │  ← MASTER HR DATA ⚠️ HIGH RISK
│ (Karyawan)  │     - NIK (KTP) 🔴 SENSITIVE
│             │     - NPWP 🔴 SENSITIVE
└─────────────┘     - Date of birth 🔴 SENSITIVE
                    - Phone, personal email

┌─────────────┐
│  PARTNERS   │  ← EXTERNAL USERS (Non-employees)
│ (Eksternal) │     - Contractors, vendors
└─────────────┘     - Limited sensitive data
```

### Key Relationships

1. **`users` ↔ `employees`**: Optional 1-to-1 relationship
   - User can exist without employee record (for external access)
   - Employee can exist without user account (no SSO access)
   - Linked via `users.employeeId` and `employees.userId`

2. **`users` ↔ `partners`**: Optional 1-to-1 relationship
   - For external users (contractors, vendors)
   - Linked via `partners.userId`

3. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - ✅ **Authentication** (users) is separated from **HR data** (employees)
   - ⚠️ **BUT** employees collection contains unencrypted PII

---

## ⚠️ Critical Compliance Gaps

### 1. **No Encryption at Rest**
- **Risk**: Data breach exposes all employee NIK, NPWP
- **Penalty**: Up to IDR 2 billion fine + criminal charges
- **Fix**: Implement MongoDB Field-Level Encryption (**Priority 1**)

### 2. **No Access Control on Sensitive Fields**
- **Risk**: Any HR role can see ALL employee data including NIK/NPWP
- **Penalty**: Violation of data minimization principle
- **Fix**: Implement role-based field-level access control (**Priority 1**)

### 3. **No Audit Trail for Data Access**
- **Risk**: Cannot prove who accessed sensitive data when
- **Penalty**: Cannot comply with investigation requests
- **Fix**: Implement comprehensive audit logging (**Priority 2**)

### 4. **No Data Masking**
- **Risk**: Sensitive data displayed in plain text on screen
- **Penalty**: Shoulder surfing, unauthorized viewing
- **Fix**: Implement data masking by default (**Priority 1**)

### 5. **No Consent Tracking**
- **Risk**: Cannot prove employee consent for data processing
- **Penalty**: Violation of UU PDP Article 20
- **Fix**: Add consent mechanism during onboarding (**Priority 2**)

### 6. **No Breach Notification System**
- **Risk**: Cannot notify within 3x24 hours if breach occurs
- **Penalty**: Additional fines for late notification
- **Fix**: Implement automated breach detection & notification (**Priority 2**)

### 7. **No Data Retention Policy**
- **Risk**: Keeping employee data indefinitely
- **Penalty**: Violation of data minimization principle
- **Fix**: Implement automated data deletion after retention period (**Priority 3**)

| **Data Minimization** | Only collect necessary data | ⚠️ Partial | Review if KTP/NPWP truly needed |
| **Purpose Limitation** | Only use data for stated purposes | ❌ No | Create privacy policy |
| **Security Measures** | Encryption, access control, audit | ❌ No | **CRITICAL** - Implement immediately |
| **Data Subject Rights** | Access, rectify, delete, export | ⚠️ Partial | Add export/delete functionality |
| **Breach Notification** | Notify within 3x24 hours | ❌ No | Create breach response plan |
| **Data Retention** | Delete after retention period | ❌ No | Implement retention policy |
