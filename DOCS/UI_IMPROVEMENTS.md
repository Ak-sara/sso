## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Realm vs Organization
In Aksara SSO:
- **Realm = Organization**
- Each organization is an isolated realm
- Similar to Keycloak's realm concept
- Supports multi-tenancy through parent-child relationships

### Navigation Hierarchy
```

Identitas (Group)
  ├─ SSO Users
  ├─ Karyawan
  └─ Partner/Eksternal
Organisasi (Group)
  ├─ Realm/Entitas
  ├─ Unit Kerja/Divisi

```

## 📱 Mobile Behavior
- Drawer slides in from left
- Overlay darkens background
- Tap outside or close button to dismiss
- Drawer stays collapsed on desktop when toggle button pressed

## 🎨 Design Principles
1. **Educational**: Info boxes teach users how to use features
2. **Organized**: Logical grouping of related features
3. **Responsive**: Works well on mobile and desktop
4. **Consistent**: Similar patterns across all pages
5. **Professional**: Clean, modern design with proper spacing

## 🎯 Employee Management Workflows (New!)

### **Comprehensive Employee Detail Page**
File: `src/routes/(app)/employees/[id]/+page.svelte`

The employee detail page now shows full organizational context with tabbed interface:

**Four Main Tabs:**
1. **Overview** - Personal info, employment status, contact details
2. **Penempatan (Assignment)** - Current and secondary assignments showing Entity → Unit Kerja → Position hierarchy
3. **SSO Access** - Linked SSO account with ability to create/revoke access
4. **History** - Timeline of all employee events (onboarding, mutations, transfers, offboarding)

**Key Features:**
- Shows employee in full context: Position at Unit Kerja in Entity
- Displays secondary assignments for multi-company placement
- Action buttons for Mutation and Offboarding
- Color-coded status badges for employment type and status
- Populated data from multiple collections (employees, organizations, org_units, positions, users)

### **Employee Onboarding Wizard**
File: `src/routes/(app)/employees/onboard/+page.svelte`

5-step progressive wizard for employee onboarding:

**Step 1: Personal Information**
- First name, last name, email, phone
- Gender, date of birth

**Step 2: Employment Information**
- NIP/Employee ID (with validation)
- Employment type (Permanent, PKWT, OS, Contract)
- Join date, probation end date

  - Email notification
  - Onboarding history logged
  - Status set to Active

**Server Implementation:** `+page.server.ts`
- Validates required fields
- Checks for duplicate employeeId and email

- Creates assignment history entry
- Redirects to employee detail page

### **Data Sync Comparison UI**
File: `src/routes/(app)/employees/sync/+page.svelte`

**Purpose:** Compare and merge employee data from multiple sources

**Three-Way Comparison:**
1. **App Database** - Current data in Aksara SSO
2. **Microsoft Entra ID** - Cloud directory data
3. **CSV Upload** - Bulk import from spreadsheet

**Features:**

- Comparison statistics dashboard:
  - Total records
  - Matching records
  - Conflicts detected
  - New records found
- Difference table showing:
  - Employee name and ID
  - Field name with conflict
  - Current App DB value
  - External source value
  - Action dropdown (Keep App DB, Use Source, Sync Both Ways, Skip)
- Bulk selection (Select All / Deselect All)
- Preview before applying changes
- Sync history log with timestamp, source, changes applied, status

**Server Actions:** `+page.server.ts`
- `compareEntraID` - Fetch from Microsoft Graph API and compare

- `applyChanges` - Apply selected changes with audit trail

**Sync History Collection:**
- Timestamp, source (entraid/csv)
